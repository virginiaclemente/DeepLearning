Starting from a dataset containing chest X-rays of healthy subjects, cancer patients and COVID-19 patients:
Realisation of a pathology recognition application with classification networks using features.
Starting from a dataset containing chest X-rays of COVID-19:
Realize an application with networks using raw images,
Validate with a 3-fold cross validation. 
The dataset at each iteration is 80% training, 10% testing, 10% validation. 
Calculate performance: accuracy, recall and precision
